A company called Moscoso has designed a new logotype, which they plan to use at three sizes: full size (display), half size, and quarter size. But there’s a problem: at smaller sizes, the finer details of this font start to disappear.

{% include inline-example.html example='size/logo-3' %}

In the absence of designed optical sizes for this family, a common reaction
might be to redesign the logotype using a “sturdier” typeface, like a flavorless sans, that can survive
display at smaller sizes or rough environments.

{% include inline-example.html example='size/logo-4' %}

With variable fonts, smaller sizes can be tuned to preserve the more delicate features of the design
without compromising the elegance of the display version. Through CSS or application math,
these tweaks can scale as the font changes size.
